# CLAUDE.md

Guidelines for this project. Apply these rules to every file generated or modified.

---

## Context

This project is a FastAPI file storage API deployed on AWS using two compute strategies:
- **Target 1** — ECS Fargate (containerized)
- **Target 2** — AWS App Runner (containerized, serverless-managed)

Infrastructure is managed with AWS CDK in TypeScript. The developer has a Terraform background and is learning CDK — keep code simple, explicit, and well-commented on CDK-specific patterns the first time they appear.

---

## Code Style

- **Simple and readable first.** If a piece of code needs a comment to be understood, rewrite it. Comments explain intent, not what the code does.
- **No clever one-liners.** Prefer explicit over implicit.
- **One responsibility per function, per class, per construct.** If it does two things, split it.
- **No dead code.** No commented-out blocks, no unused variables, no leftover TODOs.

---

## Naming

- Names must describe intent, not implementation. `grantReadWrite` not `addS3AndKmsPermissions`.
- Booleans are questions: `enableKeyRotation`, `versioned` — not `keyRotation`, `version`.
- Props interfaces end in `Props`: `FileStorageProps`, `AuthTableProps`.
- Constructs are nouns: `FileStorageConstruct`, `AuthTableConstruct`.
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood (`kms`, `iam`, `s3` are fine — `cfg`, `mgr`, `util` are not).

---

## Security

- **No hardcoded secrets.** No passwords, tokens, ARNs, or account IDs in source code. Use SSM Parameter Store.
- **No wildcard IAM actions or resources.** Every grant must be scoped to the exact action and resource needed. `s3:*` or `Resource: *` are forbidden.
- **Encryption at rest is mandatory.** Every storage resource (S3, DynamoDB) uses KMS. Never leave encryption unset.
- **Enforce HTTPS.** S3 buckets must have `enforceSSL: true`. ALB listeners must redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- **Block all public access on S3 buckets.** `BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL` always.
- **Principle of least privilege.** Grants go through construct methods (`grantReadWrite`, `grantRead`) rather than manual IAM policy statements.
- **No secrets passed as plain environment variables** to ECS or Lambda. Use SSM Parameter Store references in the task/function definition.
- **Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes** in DynamoDB. Never store plain text.

---

## CDK Constructs

- Constructs own their resources and their defaults. A construct must be usable with zero props and produce a secure, sensible result.
- Props are optional with documented defaults via JSDoc. Required props are the exception.
- Constructs expose resources as `readonly` properties. Internal details are private.
- Grants are methods on the construct — never raw `PolicyStatement` in a stack.
- **Stacks are thin.** They instantiate constructs, write SSM parameters, and nothing else.
- Removal policies default to `RETAIN`. `DESTROY` must be explicitly passed and is only acceptable in development stacks.
- Cross-stack references use **SSM Parameter Store** — never `Fn.importValue`.

---

## TypeScript

- Strict mode on. No `any`. No unsafe casts.
- Every public method and property has a JSDoc comment.
- Props interfaces are exported alongside their construct.
- No implicit `undefined` — use optional chaining and nullish coalescing explicitly.

---

## Python (FastAPI)

- Type hints on every function signature — input and output.
- No bare `except` clauses. Always catch a specific exception type.
- S3 and DynamoDB logic lives in dedicated modules (`storage.py`, `auth.py`) — never inline in route handlers.
- Passwords are verified with `bcrypt` — never compared as plain strings.
- The `/health` endpoint requires no authentication. All other endpoints require HTTP Basic Auth.
- File paths in S3 follow the pattern `files/{username}/{filename}` — always scoped to the authenticated user.

---

## Local configuration

- `.env` is generated — never edited by hand.
  - Local (LocalStack): `python scripts/generate-env.py`
  - AWS account: `python scripts/generate-env.py --profile <profile>`
- `.env` is gitignored. `.env.example` is the committed reference and must be kept in sync with `LOCAL_DEFAULTS` in `scripts/generate-env.py`.
- AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) are never stored in `.env` — use AWS CLI profiles (`aws configure --profile <name>`).
- Environments are managed via AWS accounts, not environment name flags. There is no `--env` parameter.
- Non-sensitive config (`AWS_REGION`, bucket/table names) lives in SSM Parameter Store under `/file-api/`.
- `APP_VERSION` is set to `local` by default. In CI/CD, GitHub Actions injects the git tag or SHA before running CDK deploy, which stamps the `Version` tag on every AWS resource.
- Sensitive app values (third-party API keys, etc.) live in Secrets Manager — add them to `generate-env.py` if needed.

---

## What to avoid

- No inline `PolicyStatement` in stacks — use construct grant methods.
- No hardcoded resource names — use CDK tokens or props.
- No `console.log` in CDK code.
- No `Fn.importValue` for cross-stack references — use SSM Parameter Store.
- No `any` type in TypeScript.
- No plain string comparison for passwords in Python.
